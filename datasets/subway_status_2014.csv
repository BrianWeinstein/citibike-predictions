A second, backup server failed to fully engage the signal system. While management in our Rail Control Center implemented delay mitigation strategies and operated a truncated service between Broadway Junction and Rockaway Pkwy, we were unable to provide you with the level of morning rush hour service you have come to expect. At 8:10am, the system was properly rebooted and service resumed with residual delays. It is now stable. To ensure there are no disruptions in this evenings rush hour service, or service this weekend, we have additional staff on standby to respond in the event there is another server failure.
